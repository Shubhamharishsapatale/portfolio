              <h3>'Ikshura': A Robotic Manipulator for Sugarcane Harvesting</h3>
              <span class="project-tag">MSc Dissertation</span>
              <p>
                For my MSc dissertation in Robotics at the University of
                Sheffield, I designed and evaluated 'Ikshura' a robotic
                manipulator aimed at improving sugarcane harvesting through
                automation. The project addressed challenges like labour
                shortages, crop damage, and energy inefficiency by developing a
                lightweight, precision-controlled end-effector.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created a fully parametric 3D model in Fusion 360, featuring a
                dual-gripper mechanism for stalk stabilization and a NEMA17
                motor-driven cutting blade. Finite Element Analysis using ANSYS
                revealed that a 5 mm blade design performed significantly better
                under simulated cutting stress, compared to a thinner 2 mm
                version.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the design showed promise in strength and control, future
                improvements include refining blade geometry, incorporating
                AI-driven perception, and testing under real field conditions to
                account for environmental variability.

              <p>
                Led a three-member team in developing the SLS Robot. A mobile
                platform with autonomous navigation and a 2-DOF robotic arm
                capable of whiteboard drawing. From concept to execution, we
                built the robot entirely in-house, designing the chassis and arm
                in Fusion 360 and fabricating components using laser-cut acrylic
                and 3D printing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system was powered by an Arduino Mega, integrating
                ultrasonic sensors, DC motors with encoders, and servo motors
                for precise actuation. Implemented inverse kinematics for the
                arm to accurately replicate drawings and developed sensor-based
                logic for autonomous movement, including wall-following and
                obstacle avoidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                To ensure consistent marker contact, we designed a spring-loaded
                end-effector, merging mechanical precision with intelligent
                control in a compact, task-oriented robot.

                In a team of four, I helped develop and deploy a ROS-based
                system that enabled the TurtleBot3 Waffle to autonomously
                explore and map a bounded arena using SLAM (Simultaneous
                Localization and Mapping). Starting in simulation, we
                implemented key behaviours like obstacle avoidance with LIDAR
                data, wall-following, and randomized movement.

              <p>
                These capabilities were governed by a Finite State Machine (FSM)
                to allow seamless switching between navigation modes. After
                successful virtual testing, we transitioned to real-world
                deployment, fine-tuning parameters for reliable operation.

                with a dataset of 1,055 compounds described by 41 structural and
                physicochemical features, applied Local Outlier Factor to clean
                the data, standardized the inputs, and used L2 regularization to
                improve model generalization.

                Hyperparameters were fine-tuned for optimal performance,

                was further validated with an ROC curve, yielding an AUC score

                strategic sampling methods like Full Factorial and Latin
                Hypercube Sampling, we trained an RL agent that significantly

              <p>
                For our Mechanical Engineering dissertation, my team of three
                conducted an experimental study to enhance flow boiling heat
                transfer of refrigerant R404A using custom-designed perforated
                twisted tape inserts in a horizontal tube. These inserts, with
                twist ratios of 8 and 10, served as passive turbulence promoters
                aimed at improving the thermal efficiency of low-GWP, zero-ODP
                refrigerants.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built a dedicated test rig featuring a custom evaporator
                section equipped with thermocouples and pressure transducers for
                accurate data collection. The results demonstrated a marked
                improvement in heat transfer performance, particularly in the
                lower vapor quality range (10%–50%), with only a slight increase
                in pressure drop, highlighting a practical and eco-conscious
                method to boost thermal system efficiency.
